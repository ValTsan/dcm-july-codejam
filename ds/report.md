Introduction to the Dataset

This dataset was manually compiled to support a road trip planning project focused on identifying and optimizing travel routes between popular destinations. It includes information on 10 well-known landmarks and natural attractions across the United States. For each destination, the dataset records the state, latitude, longitude, and category (e.g., landmark or natural attraction), resulting in a total of 10 rows and 5 columns.

The primary objective of this project was to first establish a baseline route by selecting the next destination at random. This initial route served as a reference point for further optimization. Using the total travel distance from the baseline route, an optimized route was then generated based on minimizing the overall distance using machine learning modeling techniques.

As the dataset was curated manually and is relatively small in size, no preprocessing or data cleaning was necessary. Additional sections of this report provide detailed descriptions of the modeling approach, visualizations used to support the analysis, and key conclusions drawn from the project.
